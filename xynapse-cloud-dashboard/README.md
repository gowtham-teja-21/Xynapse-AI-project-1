## 🎯 Project Overview
The **Xynapse Cloud Cost Dashboard (Lite Edition)** is a two-week guided internship project by **Xynapse AI**.  
The goal is to learn how cloud cost analytics works — using simulated billing data from **AWS**, **Azure**, and **GCP** — and to build a **dashboard application** that visualizes and analyzes these costs.

This project helps interns understand **multi-cloud cost management**, **data visualization**, and **basic cloud-native deployment** using free tools.
